## Reporting a Vulnerability

GitHub "Private vulnerability reporting" is enabled for The-Network-Crew/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS repository.

Or, use a publicly-available email address for The Network Crew Pty Ltd to submit it via email instead.

DO NOT raise a public issue where there is threat to users of the module. Raise it properly.

### No bounties offered (FOSS)

As a company, we do not believe in paying security bounties, rather in writing good code.

We appreciate your input and work to address issues as quickly as possible, security first and foremost.

Updates can be provided as promptly as days apart, however this depends on severity/scope, and is always reasonable.

## Thank you for responsibly disclosing
